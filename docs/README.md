# Flutter Tools MCP Documentation

This directory contains documentation resources for the Flutter Tools MCP project.

## Images

The `images` directory contains screenshots and diagrams used in the main README and other documentation:

- `cursor-setup.png`: Screenshot showing how to set up the Flutter Tools MCP server in Cursor IDE

## Adding Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Place images in the `images` directory
2. Use relative paths in documentation files
3. Keep filenames descriptive and use kebab-case (e.g., `setup-guide.md`, `ios-configuration.png`)

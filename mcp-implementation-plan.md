# Flutter Tools MCP Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to rebuild the Flutter Tools MCP server following the Anthropic MCP guidelines. We will create a proper MCP server that exposes tools for monitoring and debugging Flutter applications.

## Phase 1: Setup Project Structure

1. Update the MCP server project structure:
   - Restructure the `mcp` directory to follow MCP conventions
   - Update `package.json` to include the required dependencies and configurations
   - Configure TypeScript properly with appropriate settings

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod axios ws
   npm install -D @types/node typescript @types/ws
   ```

3. Update `tsconfig.json` to match the MCP requirements:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES2022",
       "module": "Node16",
       "moduleResolution": "Node16",
       "outDir": "./build",
       "rootDir": "./src",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
     },
     "include": ["src/**/*"],
     "exclude": ["node_modules"]
   }
   ```

## Phase 2: Implement Core MCP Server

1. Create the main server entry point (`index.ts`):
   - Import the required MCP SDK components
   - Initialize the MCP server with name and version
   - Set up the StdioServerTransport
   - Implement the main function to start the server

2. Define types and interfaces:
   - Create data models for Flutter app information
   - Define response types for the connector server API
   - Create utility interfaces for tool responses

## Phase 3: Implement Tool Definitions

1. Create tools for Flutter app discovery:
   - `list-flutter-apps`: List all running Flutter applications
   - `connect-to-app`: Connect to a specific Flutter app by ID

2. Create tools for log and metrics collection:
   - `get-app-logs`: Retrieve logs from a connected Flutter app
   - `get-performance-metrics`: Get performance metrics (memory, CPU, etc.)
   - `get-network-requests`: Fetch network request data

3. Create tools for application debugging:
   - `take-screenshot`: Capture a screenshot of the Flutter app UI
   - `get-widget-tree`: Retrieve the widget tree structure
   - `analyze-performance`: Run a performance analysis on the app

## Phase 4: Implement Connector Client Service

1. Create a service to communicate with the Flutter Connector Server:
   - Implement methods to fetch data from the connector REST API
   - Handle error cases gracefully
   - Manage connection state

2. Implement helper functions for data processing:
   - Format logs for better readability
   - Process performance metrics for visualization
   - Parse network request data

## Phase 5: Testing and Integration

1. Test the MCP server with Claude for Desktop:
   - Configure Claude to connect to our MCP server
   - Verify tool discovery and execution
   - Debug any communication issues

2. Integrate with the Flutter Connector Server:
   - Ensure proper data flow between components
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   - Optimize for performance and reliability

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Setup project structure and install dependencies
2. **Day 2**: Implement core MCP server and connector client service
3. **Day 3**: Implement tool definitions for app discovery and logs
4. **Day 4**: Implement tools for metrics collection and debugging
5. **Day 5**: Testing, integration, and optimization

## Next Steps

After completing the MCP server implementation, we will:

1. Create comprehensive documentation
2. Build example use cases and tutorials
3. Explore advanced features such as custom resources and prompts
4. Consider integration with other development environments
